My name is Zohaan Faisal, and I graduated from Cedar College. I have a SAT score of 1380. I dabble in sports such as football and basketball, although I'm not exceptional at either. From a young age, I have had a peculiar interest in Comp Sci; the limitless possibilities and evolution fascinated me and sparked my curiosity about technology.
